# JLCPCB-Basic-Parts
JL@C PCB Basic Parts Eagle Library with LCSC Part Numbers

This is a very first release of the library.
Do not use for production. Library has several issues with component rotation.

Please report any issues. Thank you.

1/12/2020 - I have added ULP scripts that can generate BOM and CPL files that are suitable for JLC PCB direct upload.
